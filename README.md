# Avalanche_module4

In the project we are creating an ERC20 token and deploying it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming.

## Description

In this project we are firstly writing a smart contract for an ERC20 token for Degen gaming and deploying it on the Avalanche network using showtract.
Showtrace basically allows you to explore and search the Avalanche C-Chain blockchain for transactions, addresses, tokens, prices and other activities taking place on Avalanche C-Chain (AVAX).
Once deployed we can track all the transactions happening on our account by just giving the account address and searching it.
